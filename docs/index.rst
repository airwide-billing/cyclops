Welcome to Cyclops's documentation!
===================================
Cyclops is an open source, community driven project led by Cloud Accounting
and Billing (CAB) initiative @ SPLAB, part of InIT - ZHAW, for creating a
flexible accounting and billing framework for IT services. Cyclops has been
specifically designed keeping requirements of popular cloud native
applications, platforms and services in mind. Widely used platforms such as
OpenStack, CloudStack, Apache Hadoop, etc. are already supported, meaning -
these can be billed out of box through Cyclops framework via appropriate
collectors.

    You may want to read `Cyclops's Developer's guide`__ (WiKi) -- the first
    bit, at least -- to get an idea of the concepts required for extending the
    framework.
